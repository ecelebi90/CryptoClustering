# CryptoClustering
    #Used Unspurvised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
    #Used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) analysis by reducing the features to three principle components
        ##Created a new database by using the withe scaled PCA data and cluster the crytocurrencies for the best value for k (elbow method) 
    #For both method, used the k-means to find the best value for k
    #Used elbow method to find the best value for k by createing a scaled Dataframe
        ##Used fewer features to cluster the crytocurrencies for the best value for k (elbow method)
